# Project Overview: Predicting NCAA Women's Basketball Divisions

# What are we trying to find out?

The central question of this project is: "Can we accurately predict an NCAA women's basketball player's division (Division I, II, or III) based on demographic and physical attributes such as height, academic year, geographic origin, and player position?"

# What do we already know?

Previous research and available data suggest differences between NCAA divisions concerning physical attributes, geographic recruiting patterns, and player demographics. It's known that Division I often recruits taller athletes and has broader geographic reach, including international players, compared to Divisions II and III.

# What are we aiming to achieve?

Success for this project means developing a reliable predictive model that accurately classifies players into NCAA divisions based on their attributes, with clear insights into the most influential factors. Achieving high accuracy and meaningful interpretations of feature importance would provide valuable information for recruitment strategies and player development programs.

# What factors affect our results?

Several factors influence project outcomes, including:

Data Quality: Accurate and complete data on players' attributes.

Feature Relevance: Effective identification and selection of meaningful predictive features (e.g., height, positions, geographic origins).

Model Selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms capable of capturing relationships within the data.

Model Optimization: Proper tuning of algorithm hyperparameters to maximize performance.

# Is there something new we can use?

This project incorporates a comprehensive machine learning pipeline, including extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), robust feature engineering, and advanced modeling techniques such as Random Forest with hyperparameter optimization. Leveraging recent NCAA datasets, including detailed player demographics and geographic indicators, provides novel insights previously less explored in NCAA division classification studies.

Through this integrated approach, the project aims to enhance predictive accuracy, generate actionable insights, and potentially inform strategic decisions in NCAA women's basketball recruitment and development.
